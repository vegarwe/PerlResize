Setup:
======

For now the $cache variable (where to store resized images) has to be set in
directly in the module. Other than that all that is needed is to set the
perlhandler for the images or image directories that needs resizing.

sample <Location> directive:

  <Location /images>
  	SetHandler perl-script
  	PerlHandler PerlResize
  </Location>

The mod_perl should be configured to load libraries. Sample startup.pl is
provided with the package. mods-enabled/perl.conf could look like this:
  PerlRequire "/etc/apache2/perl/startup.pl"
  PerlSwitches -wT

Modules needed:
===============

aptitude install libimage-magick-perl libmime-perl libmime-types-perl libwww-perl 
aptitude install libapache2-request-perl libapache2-mod-perl2-dev libapache-session-perl libapache-dbi-perl

TODO:
=====

* $cache directory has to be set with PerSetVar somehow...
* Test different kinds of $err combinations to verify that it works
* Add etag in addition to Last-Modified
* Figure out why sendfile($file) didn't set 'Last-Modified' even thoug mtime
  was set.
